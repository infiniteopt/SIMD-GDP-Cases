# Advances to Modelling and Solving Infinite-Dimensional Optimization Problems in `InfiniteOpt.jl`
## Infinite-Dimensional Optimization Case Studies
This repository contains the source code Julia scripts used in the case studies 
featured in the manuscript "Advances to Modelling and Solving Infinite-Dimensional Optimization Problems in `InfiniteOpt.jl`" by Evelyn Gondosiswanto and Joshua L. Pulsipher.

## Implementation
First, you'll need to install Julia (available at https://julialang.org/downloads/).
Then you'll find instructions about running the case studies in the `README.md` 
files within the InfiniteGDP and InfiniteExaModels folders.
